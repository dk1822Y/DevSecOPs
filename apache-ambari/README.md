# Apache Ambari

The Apache Ambari project aims to enhance the simplicity of Hadoop cluster management by developing software for provisioning, overseeing, and monitoring Apache Hadoop clusters. Ambari features an intuitive and user-friendly web interface for Hadoop management, complemented by its RESTful APIs.

## Cluster Management

Ambari allows users to set up and manage Hadoop clusters, including configuring and deploying various components such as HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System), MapReduce, Hive, HBase, and others.

## Configuration Management

Users can easily configure and customize Hadoop components through the web-based interface, making it more accessible for administrators to adjust settings according to their specific requirements.

## Monitoring and Alerts

Ambari provides monitoring capabilities to track the performance and health of the Hadoop cluster. It also supports alerting, notifying administrators about any issues or anomalies in the cluster.

## Security

The platform includes features for managing security aspects of the Hadoop cluster, such as authentication and authorization. It helps administrators set up secure environments for handling big data.

## Stack Extensions

Ambari supports extensions for different Hadoop stack versions and provides a framework for adding new services and components to the cluster.

## RESTful API

Ambari offers a RESTful API that allows automation and integration with other tools and systems for more seamless management.
