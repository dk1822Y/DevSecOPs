# IBM Operational Decision Manager

IBM Operational Decision Manager (ODM) is a Business Rule Management System (BRMS) that provides a comprehensive decision automation solution. IBM consist of three different tools Decision Server Insights (DSI), Decision Server Rules (DSR), and Decision Center (DC). It combines decision making and change detection tools to provide a business rule management system that is easy to evolve, trace, and manage. IBM ODM can be installed both independently and as an application running on IBM WebSphere Application Server. The application coordinates decision life cycle, covering both business rules and business events, and allowing editing of each. It provides a repository and management component for the creation and maintenance of decision logic, guiding the business system's behavior.

`Decision Server Insights`: This tool provides real-time decision-making capabilities by analyzing and correlating data from multiple sources, such as social media, sensors, and transactional systems. It can be used to detect patterns, trends, and anomalies, and trigger automated decisions based on the results.

`Decision Server Rules`: This tool provides a business rule management system that allows organizations to automate and manage complex decision-making processes. It includes a rule engine that can evaluate rules and make decisions based on the results. It also includes tools for authoring, testing, and deploying decision services.

`Decision Center`: This tool provides a collaborative environment for managing and authoring business rules and decision services. It includes a web-based user interface that allows business users and developers to work together to create, test, and deploy decision services. It also includes features such as version control, auditing, and reporting

IBM ODM can be used to develop decision-making systems that help doctors diagnose medical conditions with high precision and customization. For example, Omdena has utilized recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to combine sequential and static feature modeling to predict cardiac arrest.
